# projects
cool stuff im building in the ML and AI space. This repo helps me track my progress from basic cloud functions to ml algos and entire AI projects that can run locally. 

## how i work

- build fast, break stuff, fix it cleaner
- learn by doing, not just reading docs (though docs are very important. Shoutout to substack for just existing)
- keep it fun. if it’s boring, i’m doing it wrong
