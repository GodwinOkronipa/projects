# projects
cool stuff im building in the cloud and AI space. Ive set a goal for myself to become a super cracked cloud infra, ml and AI eng by EOY 2025. This repo helps me track my progress from basic cloud functions to ml algos and entiire AI projects that can run locally. 

## how i work

- build fast, break stuff, fix it cleaner
- learn by doing, not just reading docs (though docs are very important. Shoutout to substack for just existing)
- keep it fun. if it’s boring, i’m doing it wrong

## shoutout to future me

if you're reading this and you're cracked now, good job. if not, keep going. we’re building something wild here.
