# ML-Algorithms 

A collection of foundational Machine Learning algorithms implemented from scratch or using standard libraries to demonstrate core concepts.

##  Included Algorithms

- **Linear Regression**: Predicting continuous values using a linear relationship.
- **Logistic Regression**: A go-to for binary classification tasks.
- **Decision Trees**: Tree-based logic for both classification and regression.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Classification based on proximity to labeled data.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Unsupervised learning to find patterns and groups in data.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Dimensionality reduction for data visualization and simplification.

##  Getting Started

Each script is self-contained. You can run them directly using Python:

```bash
python linearRegression.py
python kmeansclustering.py
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn (for comparison or utility functions)
- Matplotlib (for visualizations)

*Classic machine learning implementations for quick reference and learning.*
